Want to help us? Check it out, see if you can help.
See the [greenbook-app](https://github.com/spicygreenbook/greenbook-app) repo! 

# greenbook
Code base for the website [spicygreenbook.com](https://spicygreenbook.com) which is a directory of local black-owned businesses that users can find to support

## Want to report a bug or issue with the website?
Use the [issues](https://github.com/spicygreenbook/greenbook/issues) section on this page to let us know!

## How To Contribute Code
The app is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and is hosted/deployed on [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com) (formerly now.sh)

## What do I need to know to contribute code?
**Absolutely Critical**: JavaScript

**Helps a lot**: Git/GitHub, React, NextJS, CSS, HTML, Understanding fetching JSON data from an API

## How to get started coding on this app
```sh
    # clone the repo
    git clone git@github.com:spicygreenbook/greenbook.git

    # change your directory into the greenbook repo
    cd greenbook

    # install node modules
    npm install

    # run the dev server
    # this should make http://localhost:3000 available in your web browser
    npm run dev

```

### Get familiar with the file and data structure with NextJS
 - All front-end page end-points are in the pages folder. Making file at `pages/hello.js` will create the spicygreenbook.com/hello page on the site.
 - All static files go into the public folder. Creating a file in `public/my-file.jpg` will create the spicygreenbook.com/my-file.jpg url resolve to that file.
 - We get data from prismic.io using the `utils/getListings.js` helper function that you can look at to figure out how to retreive content from the CMS
 - You will see `filename.module.css` in the `css/` folder which is css that you can write and include in a component. See any page for an example of usage.
 - Files in the `pages/api` folder will automatically become lambda functions that provide a simple request/response promise as the primary function export. See [Vercel Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction)
 - We use [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) for the icons at the moment. Look at `components/Icons.js` to see how to add each individually needed Icon
 - **The entire site is statically built upon deployment. Every page/listing is a static html file delivered straight from the CDN. Any time a new commit is pushed to master, or a document is published in prismic, a new deployment is created and the whole site is updated at once.**

## Pretty new to github?
